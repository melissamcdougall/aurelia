# Aurelia

> Standalone tool · Part of the [lamina](https://github.com/benaskins/lamina-mono) workspace

A process supervisor for macOS developers — manages native processes and Docker containers with dependency ordering, health checks, and automatic restarts.

## Why Aurelia

If you run a mix of native services and containers on macOS, your options are limited. docker-compose doesn't manage native processes. Procfile runners like overmind don't do dependency ordering or health checks. You end up stitching together multiple tools or wrapping everything in containers.

Aurelia handles native processes, containers, dependencies, health checks, and routing under one supervisor. It integrates with macOS Keychain for secrets and Apple Silicon GPU APIs for observability — features that only make sense on macOS, but work well there.

| | Aurelia | process-compose | Overmind / Goreman | docker-compose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sweet spot | macOS, mixed native + container stacks | Cross-platform process orchestration | Simple Procfile runner | All-container stacks |
| Native processes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| Containers | yes | no | no | yes |
| Dependency ordering | yes | yes | no | yes |
| Health checks | yes | yes | no | yes |

**Not** a production tool, container orchestrator, or cross-platform solution. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for design rationale.

## Features

- YAML service definitions — one file per service in `~/.aurelia/services/`
- Native processes and Docker containers under one supervisor
- Dependency ordering with cascade-stop for hard dependencies
- HTTP, TCP, and exec health checks with configurable thresholds
- Automatic restart with fixed or exponential backoff
- Crash recovery — re-adopts running processes across daemon restarts
- Dynamic port allocation from a configurable range
- Zero-downtime blue-green deploys for routed services
- Traefik routing config generation
- macOS Keychain secret injection with audit logging
- Apple Silicon GPU/VRAM/thermal observability
- LaunchAgent install for auto-start on login

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- **macOS** — Aurelia uses macOS-specific APIs (Keychain, Metal/IOKit) and is not cross-platform
- **Go 1.26+** with cgo enabled — for building from source

**Optional (needed only if you use the corresponding features):**

- **Docker or OrbStack** — for `type: container` services
- **Traefik** — for routing; Aurelia generates Traefik dynamic config files, Traefik serves them
- **just** — task runner used by `script/bootstrap` and development commands (installed automatically by bootstrap)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benaskins/aurelia
cd aurelia
script/bootstrap
```

Or without just:

```bash
go build -o aurelia ./cmd/aurelia/
```

For a leaner binary without container or GPU support:

```bash
just build-lean
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a service spec:

```yaml
# ~/.aurelia/services/api.yaml
service:
  name: api
  type: native
  command: ./bin/api
  working_dir: ~/myproject

network:
  port: 8080

health:
  type: http
  path: /healthz
  port: 8080
  interval: 10s
```

2. Start the daemon and bring up services:

```bash
aurelia daemon &
aurelia up
aurelia status
```
